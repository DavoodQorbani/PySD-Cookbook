Pysd and Exploratory Modeling Analysis Workbench\r\n\r\nThis cookbook is intended as a resource for system dynamics practitioners working to use big data to \r\nimprove their modeling practice. We strive to make each recipe short, simple to understand, and transferable, \r\nso that the script can be copied and adapted to the desired problem.\r\n\r\nWe start each recipe with a description of the technique, and a discussion of how it is useful to the SD practitioner.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
