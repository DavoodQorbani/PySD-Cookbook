Bringing the tools of system dynamics to the wider world of data science allows us to operate within our core competency as model builders, and avoids doubled effort. It allows those who are familiar with programming to explore using system dynamics in their own projects, and ensures that the learning system dynamicists do to use these external tools will have application in the wider world."

As a result, it is [becoming increasingly popular](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) and is the focus for development of a wealth of [data science tools](http://pydata.org/downloads/).\n",
