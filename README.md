This cookbook is intended as a resource for system dynamics practitioners working to use big data to 
improve their modeling practice. We strive to make each recipe short, simple to understand, and transferable, 
so that the script can be copied and adapted to the desired problem.

We start each recipe with a description of the technique, and a discussion of how it is useful to the SD practitioner.
