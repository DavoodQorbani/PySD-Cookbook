Fitting a suite of datasets
===========================

In this recipe, we'll consider ways to fit a model to a large number of
datasets.

Ingredients
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A set of parallel systems, with one model to describe them all

Method 1: Get a single best value for all datasets together

Method 2: get a distribution of values by fitting once to each dataset

The case: In this notebook, we'll use a dataset of the
