Getting Started with Python
===========================

Why programming?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a whole world of computational and analysis tools being
developed in the larger data science community. If system dynamicists
want to take advantage of these tools, we have two options:

1. we can **replicate each of them within one of the system dynamics
   modeling tools we are familiar with**
2. we can **bring system dynamics models to the environment where these
   tools already exist**.

PySD and this cookbook are an outgrowth of the belief that this second
path is the best use of our time. Bringing the tools of system dynamics
to the wider world of data science allows us to operate within our core
competency as model builders, and avoids doubled effort. It allows those
who are familiar with programming to explore using system dynamics in
their own projects, and ensures that the learning system dynamicists do
to use these external tools will have application in the wider world.

Why Python?
~~~~~~~~~~~

Python is a high-level programming language that allows users to write
code quickly and spend less time mucking about with the boring bits of
programming. As a result, it is `becoming increasingly
popular <http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html>`__ and is the focus for
development of a wealth of `data science
tools <http://pydata.org/downloads/>`__.

Resources for learning to program using Python.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  To get started learning python, an excellent collection of resources
   is available in `The Hitchhiker's Guide to
   Python <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/>`__.
-  To try Python in the browser visit
   `learnpython.org <http://www.learnpython.org/>`__.
-  Check out this `overview of Python for computational
   statistics <https://people.duke.edu/~ccc14/sta-663/IntroductionToPythonSolutions.html>`__
